						<h2>How to store?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class='container-tx2-block darkmode-txt'>
						<p>
							 fter the acquisition, it is necessary to ensure reliable storage of the cryptocurrency, which guarantees protection against hacking and theft. Cryptocurrency is usually stored in crypto wallets. These are physical devices or online programs used to securely store private keys to cryptocurrencies. Some exchanges provide wallet services, thanks to which the storage of cryptocurrency funds is carried out directly by the platform itself, however, not all exchanges and brokers automatically provide such services.<br><br>

There are also different wallet providers. There are two types of funds storage: "hot wallet" and "cold wallet".<br><br>

A hot wallet is a cryptographic storage that uses online programs to protect private keys to assets.
A cold wallet (also called a hardware wallet), unlike a hot wallet, uses offline electronic devices to securely store private keys.<br><br>

As a rule, there is a fee for using cold wallets, while there is no fee for using hot wallets.<a href="https://trustwallet.com/">The most trusted & secure crypto wallet.</a>

						<h2>Future of Akitacoin</h2>
					</div>
					<div class='container-tx2-block darkmode-txt'>
						<p>
							 Of course, you should not buy up all the new meme-coins in the hope that at least a few of them will rise sharply in price under the influence of crypto-influencers. On the other hand, the success of Akitacoin depends entirely on the activity of its community.<br>
							 However, an increase in the number of memcoins of all kinds is inevitable (even if we take into account the attempts of the government to ban them, as was the case in Thailand), as the tools for creating tokens become more accessible. For example, the Meme.com website has already appeared - a new marketplace where users can compare meme-cryptocurrencies and create their own meme-coins, the value of which will depend entirely on how relevant trends and memes they display.<br><br>
							 In the meantime, we have an unsecured asset that wants to infuse its $38 billion worth with the power of memes.
