One of the great things about Akitacoin is that nobody or no organization “owns” the Akitacoin blockchain: it is completely open source, permissionless, decentralized and peer-to-peer. Akitacoin nodes function via a decentralized consensus mechanism to prevent malicious actors from gaining control over the network.

This decentralized control through the security nodes that Akitacoin security is handled in a peer-to-peer network without the need for a controlling central part such as a bank.Cool, yeah?
